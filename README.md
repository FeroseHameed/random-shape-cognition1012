Project Title: 
  Random Shape Cognition

Project Summary: (As per Sample 9 description)
  "Webpage has 4 shapes on it: circle, square, triangle, and rectangle for example (can be any 4
  shapes). The webpage will highlight one of those shapes, and the user must click on it (highlight
  meaning make it clear that the shape is to be selected). If the user clicks on the correct image,
  the server will highlight the same shape, and one new additional shape. The user must now click
  on those 2, in the correct order. The server randomly determines which random shape will be
  highlighted and saves the order of highlighted images in an array on its server-side JS."
  **(As recommended by the TA) In addition we will implement a leaderboard onto the webpage.**
