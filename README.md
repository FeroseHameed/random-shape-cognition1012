**Project Title:**

  Random Shape Cognition


**Project Summary:** (As per Sample 9 description)

  "Webpage has 4 shapes on it: circle, square, triangle, and rectangle for example (can be any 4
  shapes). The webpage will highlight one of those shapes, and the user must click on it (highlight
  meaning make it clear that the shape is to be selected). If the user clicks on the correct image,
  the server will highlight the same shape, and one new additional shape. The user must now click
  on those 2, in the correct order. The server randomly determines which random shape will be
  highlighted and saves the order of highlighted images in an array on its server-side JS."
  Lastly, a leaderboard will display all players records and will also be connected to the JS server side. 
  
  Additional features will include a timer showing the amount of time elapsed, settings to alter the difficulty/modes of the game, 
  and color variants upon different inputs to help the player verify if they are progressing accordingly. Leaderboards will 
  only be updated if the player decides to save their record by inputting their username and clicking update. Setting alterations 
  can only be made prior to attempting a match, changes cannot be made during a match. Players will be able to pause and 
  resume matches, as well as quit during a match which will automatically discard their current match record. Color variants
  will be applied for shape highlighting, and mouse inputs.


**Functional Requirements:**

  •	Webpage will highlight random shapes
  
  •	Users can click on shapes and if the correct shape is clicked, another shape will be highlighted
  
  •	If the incorrect shape is clicked, the user will be prompted to start a new game
  
  •	User will be able to identify which shape they are hovering above depending on the color of the shape highlight
  
  •	Order of highlighted shapes will be outputted from an array
  
  •	User’s shape identification record will be recorded in an object-based array
  
  •	Object will consist of User’s username, quantity of highlighted shapes reached and the date and time of the acheivement 
  
  •	Data will be saved on the JS server
  
  •	Users will view the data as a leaderboard in HTML format
  
  •	Users will have configurable settings such as adjustable speeds for shape highlighting (aka difficulty multiplier settings)
  
  •	Users will be able to view shapes using different interfaces
